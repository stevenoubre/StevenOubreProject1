        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>As I began my career in college athletics as a graduate assistant, I was introduced to UI and UX design in classes I was talking. I loved how development met design. Not just the interface, but the importanc of good user flow to create a successful project.</p>
        <p>I knew I was going to need to learn a little bit of code to communicate with developers. But then I figured why not learn code and have complete control over the whole process? It certainly helps to have a team with people that can do everything, but I want to know everything that goes into creating digital products.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to get started with my first project with the TreeHouse Tech Degree program.</p>
